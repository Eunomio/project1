                                <h5>(8TH CENTURY BC) BY HOMER</h5>
                                <p>“Probably there was one great master—later called Homer by the Greeks—who pulled the whole thing together around 750 BC. Whoever he was, he had the brilliant idea of cutting through all the myths and legends surrounding the Fall of Troy (if historical, it would have happened around 1200 BC) to focus on a single theme: the anger of Achilles.…Through Achilles the pity, terror and horror of war is focused, as well as its screaming thrills and delights.”</p>
                                <p>“Even after thousands of years, it still conveys the intensity of combat with startling immediacy.”</p>
                                <p>“Homer presents the clash of fundamental approaches: straightforward martial power and prowess, as embodied by Achilles, and wisdom or cunning, as practiced by Odysseus.”</p>

                                <h5>(423-411 BC) BY THUCYDIDES</h5>
                                <p>“One of the ironies of the writing of military history is that the greatest book on war ever written was the second history ever written—namely, this work. Thucydides examines the great themes of war from the highest levels of the making of strategy and policy to the moral dimensions and the sharp end of battle. Few military historians have done it as well, none better.”</p>
                                <p>“Written more than 2,000 years ago, this book still contains the best description of why countries go to war, the best funeral oration and the best depiction of political realism ever set down in print.”</p>
                                <p>“The first great book on war in all its aspects, and still one of the best.”</p>

                                <p>“Tolstoy's depiction of the 1812 Battle of Borodino and the events leading up to that terrible battle is the finest piece of war fiction ever written.”</p>
                                <p>“The Battle of Borodino is probably the best account of the gritty warfare of this period, to say nothing of Napoleon’s abandonment of 30,000 sick and wounded in the city of Vilnius, Lithuania.”</p>

                                <p>Ran, which translates as “Chaos,” is both a mammoth film and a tiny one. Kurosawa employed armies of extras — and burned massive sets to the ground — to depict the strife. Simply as a technical accomplishment, it should be on any list of the greatest war films ever made. But it's also the story of one man's tragic end and of his horrifying rush of reflection and regret. As Hidetora watches the destruction of everything he's built, he realizes too late how little his accomplishments matter, how much virtue he’s cast aside to achieve them, and how time humbles even the proudest. All that fighting and death has accomplished nothing. Maybe, as the title suggests, war affronts the natural order and the blood we spill poisons the land for which we fight.</p>

                                <h3><b>Paths of Glory (1957)</b></h4>
                                <p>It's worth keeping Truffaut's famous quote (told to the Chicago Tribune in 1973) in mind when thinking about Paths of Glory. If even the most pacifist-minded war films often end up glamorizing war — and Truffaut specifically suggested they did later in the same interview  — Stanley Kubrick's 1957 adaptation of Humphrey Cobb's World War I novel comes closest to slipping through that trap. Beyond depicting the sheer brutality of trench warfare, it serves as an indictment of the act of war itself. Over the course of the film, officers order soldiers to their death in a battle they know they can’t win, one soldier betrays another to cover up a crime, and the film treats self-sacrifice less as a noble virtue than a value extolled because of its military usefulness. Heroism never enters the picture, apart from the willingness of Kirk Douglas's Colonel Dax to try to expose the hypocrisy and wrongdoing of executing three men for cowardice.</p>

Under air and ground cover from British and French forces, troops were slowly and methodically evacuated from the beach using every serviceable naval and civilian vessel that could be found. At the end of this heroic mission, 330,000 French, British, Belgian and Dutch soldiers were safely evacuated.</p>

                                <p>In complete contrast to Churchill's solemn delivery, Virginia lawyer and revolutionary colonist Patrick Henry took the podium at Saint John's Church in Richmond, Virginia, in 1775 and thundered forth with a speech so convincing and so inspirational that Thomas Jefferson himself regarded Henry as the leader of the revolution. His peroration goes for the throats of his fellow revolutionaries, calling them out either to embrace the noble experiment of democracy or admit that without the choice, life wasn't worth living: "Is life so dear or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take, but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!"</p>

                                <p>We mentioned it in the intro, but a speech this good deserves a second one. </p>
                                <p>It was early June of 1940 and the British Expeditionary Force had just completed an amazing evacuation at Dunkirk, saving hundreds of thousands of soldiers who had been marked for death. But Winston Churchill knew this was no reason for celebration but a startling wake-up call, and he rallied the British with an extraordinary address to the House of Commons and all of England, telling them: "We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be… we shall never surrender!"</p>

                                <p>Unlike the florid, highly stylized, two-hour speech given by Edward Everett before him, President Lincoln's three-minute address to consecrate Gettysburg in 1863 was just 278 words long, nearly 200 of them your everyday single-syllable words. In the English language, there is no more pure, noble or dignified speech than this address, none more frequently quoted or so widely admired. In a top 10 list of public speeches, it should always be at No. 1, but even though it inspired the Union to fight on, among top 10 inspiring war speeches it lands here.</p>
